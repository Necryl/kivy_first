project I used to learn kivy

I followed two tutorial series for this. The second one wasn't trying to create an end result as I expected, instead he was just demonstrating some kivy concepts. So the code was actually reset and rebuilt multiple times and in the end it isn't really anything much. Well, I did learn some kivy concepts though.

Now I will make a new project to follow another tutorial to make a flappy bird game with kivy.
